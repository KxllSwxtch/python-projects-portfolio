# EDA for Flight Ticket Prices

This is where I start my Data Analysis journey. I will be scraping websites and web apps, analyze data and maybe use machine learning in order to at least help someone.

Even though I am not able to get a Data Science Degree because I don't meet the admission requirements I still love it and it's a part of my programming hobby.

## Packages used for this project

1. Pandas - for data cleaning and analysis
2. Seaborn - to visually display data
3. Datetime - for date objects manipulations

## Project Idea

For this web scraping project, first, I picked a dataset from Kaggle.com called Flight Price Predictions
